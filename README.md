# Web3 Type Converter

I built this tool so I could easily convert a hex/bytes32 string into a string or number (and vice versa).

Hopefully it's also useful to you.

Uses [Deno](https://deno.land) as a backend (though you could just serve the `src` directory with any other tool).

Deploy by pushing to the `main` branch (deployed via [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)).

View locally using `make start`.
